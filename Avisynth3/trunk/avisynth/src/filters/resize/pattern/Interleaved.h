//  Interleaved
//
//  The pattern datas for 2 pixels are interleaved,
//  with coefficients coded as shorts and grouped by 2.
//  Besides the offsets are guaranteed even (done by inserting coeffs to compensate)
//
//  For that:
//     size (number of pixels) is rounded even up (may introduce dummy pixel data)
//     count is padded to the next even value (so we have room for the compensation)    
//
//  It produces the following layout:
//    off0 | off1 | coeff block | coeff block ... coeff block | off0 | off1 | coeff block ...
//                    <----      count / 2 times      ---->
//
//  Where  | coeff block |  =  | c0a|c0b | c1a|c1b |   2 short coeffs for each pixel
//
//  The pattern is 8 bytes aligned, making each offset int aligned
//  and each coeff block 8 bytes aligned
//
