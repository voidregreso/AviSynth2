//  Block
//
//  Holds an aligned block of memory, with automatic deallocation.
//
//  Two behaviors are provided :
//    - basic behavior : 
//         allocation done at construction and deallocation at destruction
//    - recycling behavior :
//         a list of block of memory (and their size) is maintained.
//      At construction it attempts to reuse one from this list if size match.
//      At destruction, the block of memory is stored (back) into the list.
//
//  The recycling behavior is fully synchronised and can serve multiple threads at once.
//
//
//  Problem: The recycling list only grows and never release memory,
//             even when some sizes are never requested anymore....
//
