 * @section build_intro Introduction
 *
 * Avisynth 3.0 can be built from sources on Windows and on several
 * Unix systems. The development being done on Windows using  VC++
 * .NET 2003 (VC 7.1) and Linux x86 using g++, it is known to compile
 * on this platforms. Nevertheless, some tests have been made on
 * Windows with Msys/MinGW (that is, with g++ on Windows) and Linux
 * amd64.
 *
 * On Windows as well as on Linux/Unix, if you compile Avisynth from
 * sources, you will need some dependencies. They are described in
 * each of the sections. Nevertheless, if your system has already some
 * (all) of these depdendencies, it's useless to install them.
 *
 * In any case, you'll have to have some good knowledge in order to
 * compile Avisynth from source.
